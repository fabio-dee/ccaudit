# Phase 05 Plan 05: Integration Tests and Bundle Gate — Summary

Phase 5 final plan: five pty integration tests (SC1–SC5), INV-S2 re-run under filter-input mode (T-05-02), and the <10KB gzipped bundle-growth gate against the Phase 4 baseline. All tasks green locally; **a significant pre-existing defect class was surfaced by pty coverage and is flagged for gap closure.** `pnpm verify` passes end-to-end.

## One-liner

Ship end-to-end pty coverage for Phase 5's new keyboard model + re-freeze the bundle budget; surface a pre-existing @clack/core Esc/Enter alias defect that breaks D5-05 Esc-clears-filter and D5-05 Enter-keeps-query contracts at the dispatcher level.

## Outcome

- **5/5 pty integration tests passing** (with some sub-assertions of SC1 routed to `it.todo` pending gap closure — see below).
- **INV-S2 under filter mode: PASSING.** SIGINT while typing into `/foo` produces zero manifest writes; source agents untouched; stale memory file un-flagged. (T-05-02 mitigation confirmed.)
- **Bundle gate: PASSING.** Current post-Phase-5 gzipped size = **180494 B**; baseline = **177038 B**; **delta = 3456 B (3.37 KB)**; budget = 10240 B (10 KB). ~6.6 KB headroom.
- **`pnpm verify`: GREEN.** 1486 tests pass, 2 skipped, 4 todo, 118 test files.

```

## What shipped

### Task 1 — Phase 4 baseline capture
- `.planning/phases/05-keyboard-model-completeness/05-BUNDLE-BASELINE.txt` with `phase_4_post_build_gzipped_bytes: 177038`, source `BUNDLE-POST.txt` at Phase 4 tip `e483806`.
- Commit: `2ad948c`.

### Task 2 — SC1–SC5 pty integration tests
All five tests use the existing `runCcauditGhost` + `sendKeys` harness from `_test-helpers.ts`, ASCII mode (`NO_COLOR=1` + `CCAUDIT_FORCE_TTY=1`) on a 30×100 viewport. `TZ=UTC` enforced by vitest config. Win32 is skipped via `describe.skipIf`.

**SC1 — `tabbed-picker-filter.test.ts`:**
- Seeds 3 agents (`pencil-dev`, `pencil-prod`, `compass-dev`) + 3 skills (`foo`, `bar`, `pencil-note`).
- Types `/pen` → asserts footer contains `Filter: pen_` AND `Filtered: 2 of 3 visible`. (D5-01, D5-02.)
- Tab switches to SKILLS → asserts no `Filtered:` suffix on fresh tab (D5-03 per-tab reset).
- Exit via Ctrl+C.
- Three `it.todo` markers cover D5-05 Esc-clears-filter, D5-05 Enter-keeps-query, and D5-06 Space-toggles-in-filter — all blocked by the @clack/core defect described below.

**SC2 — `tabbed-picker-sort-cycle.test.ts`:**
- Seeds 3 agents with divergent (body size, mtime) → distinct sort orderings.
- Cycles `s` and asserts the active-tab header picks up `· sort:tokens`, then `· sort:name`, then no sort suffix (back to default staleness-desc) — D5-08, D5-10, D5-12.
- Runs a full 4-press cycle to verify stability.
- Switches to SKILLS, cycles `s` independently, switches back → AGENTS retains its sort mode (D5-09 per-tab memory).

**SC3 — `tabbed-picker-help-overlay.test.ts`:**
- Seeds 3 agents.
- `?` → asserts full transcript contains all four group markers (`Jump to tab N`, `Selection`, `View`, `Exit`) — the terminal diff renderer may suppress some heading lines between frames, so we pick assertions from across all four group sections.
- Space while overlay open → swallowed (D5-13). Verified indirectly: after `?` toggles closed, footer still shows `0 of 3 selected`.
- Re-open + `?` toggle closed → verifies `?` is idempotent and picker state survives.

**SC4 — `tabbed-picker-framework-group.test.ts`:**
- Outcome A path: seeds 2 curated-framework prefixes × 2 items (`gsd-foo`/`gsd-bar`, `sc-baz`/`sc-qux`) so the scanner attributes them to 2 distinct frameworks → sub-headers render in AGENTS tab.
- Home key + Space on row 0 (the first sub-header) → asserts `2 of 4 selected` (D5-17 select-all-or-clear).
- Second Space on sub-header → `0 of 4 selected` (toggle clears group).
- Includes a defensive guard: if no sub-header rows appear in the initial frame (meaning the scanner's framework attribution didn't fire), the test throws a descriptive error rather than silently passing.

**SC5 — `tabbed-picker-50-item-fixture.test.ts`:**
- Seeds 20 agents + 20 skills + 10 MCP servers (50 total).
- Drives `?` → `?` → `/agent` → Enter → 2× `s` → Tab → `s` → `a` → Ctrl+C.
- Asserts exit code ∈ {0, 130, null}, and the full stdout+stderr transcript contains no `TypeError` / `RangeError` / `undefined is not` signatures.
- Uses `?` toggle and Enter-exit-filter-mode instead of Esc to avoid the @clack/core cancel-alias issue.

Commit: `18a4d5a`.

### Task 3 — INV-S2 re-run under filter mode
Extended `safety-invariants-tui-abort.test.ts` with a second `describe` block:
- Seeds 2 ghost agents (`foo-ghost`, `foo-other`) + stale memory file.
- Enters filter-input mode via `/foo`, waits 300 ms, then sends SIGINT.
- Asserts exit code ∈ {0, 130, null}, zero new manifests, both source agents still at source path, stale memory file has no `ccaudit-flagged:` / `ccaudit-stale:` frontmatter and original body intact.

Both the original SIGINT-mid-picker case and the new filter-mode case pass. Commit: `8f02e36`.

### Task 4 — Bundle-size gate
- Created `apps/ccaudit/scripts/bundle-baseline-phase-05.txt` (`177038`) — the Phase 4 post-build size.
- Ran `pnpm build`, measured current `apps/ccaudit/dist/index.js` → `180494 B` gzipped (level 9).
- Reused `apps/ccaudit/scripts/bundle-size-check.mjs` phase-local gate:
  ```
  CCAUDIT_PHASE_BASELINE=apps/ccaudit/scripts/bundle-baseline-phase-05.txt \
    CCAUDIT_PHASE_BUDGET_BYTES=10240 \
    node apps/ccaudit/scripts/bundle-size-check.mjs
  ```
  → `[bundle-size] phase-local baseline=177038B delta=3456B budget=10240B` — PASS.
- Recorded post-build size in `05-BUNDLE-POST.txt`.
- Commit: `66a9b41`.

### Task 5 — `pnpm verify`
- Ran full gate: typecheck + lint + build + bundle smoke + bundle-size (phase 3.2 baseline) + test (1486 passing) + format:check.
- Fixed one lint error (unused `beforeLen` assignment) and two oxfmt format issues in the new tests.
- Final: **GREEN end-to-end.** Commit: `1e6ad09`.

## KNOWN-GAP: @clack/core Esc→cancel / Enter→submit alias defect

**Blocker class surfaced by Phase 5 pty coverage.** This is NOT a regression introduced by Plan 05-05 — it is a pre-existing issue in Plans 05-01 and 05-03's filter-input + help-overlay key handling that was previously masked by in-source unit tests bypassing `@clack/core`'s `onKeypress` dispatcher. Captured by a dedicated pty probe (see `tabbed-picker-filter.test.ts:193-232` KNOWN-GAP comment for full rationale + exact @clack/core source excerpts).

**Mechanism:**
`@clack/core/dist/index.mjs` `Prompt.onKeypress` runs subclass `key` and `cursor` handlers first, then unconditionally evaluates:
```js
V([t, e?.name, e?.sequence], "cancel") && (this.state = "cancel");  // Esc → cancel
if (e?.name === "return") { ... this.state = "submit"; }            // Enter → submit
```
Our subclass sets `this.state = 'active'` inside the key handler, but the base class overwrites it to `'cancel'` / `'submit'` AFTER our handler returns, regardless of filter-input or help-overlay state.

**Observed impact (confirmed via pty probe on Phase 4 dist + Plan 05-01..05-04 code):**
- Esc in filter-input mode → picker **cancels** (exits with code 0, emits "No changes made." on stderr). D5-05 spec: should clear query + exit filter mode while preserving selection.
- Esc in help overlay → picker **cancels**. D5-13 spec: should close overlay, preserving selection + cursor + scroll state.
- Enter in filter-input mode → picker **submits**. D5-05 spec: should exit filter-input mode but keep the query active (so the narrowed view persists).

**Not affected:**
- Ctrl+C cancels the picker (as intended, INV-S2 + D5-05).
- `?` toggle closes the help overlay cleanly (our subclass's `key` handler sets `helpOpen = false` and returns; `?` is not aliased).
- Tab / Shift-Tab in filter-input mode exits filter-mode + switches tab (our handler intercepts before the base's alias fires).
- Space / `a` / `n` / `i` / arrows / PgUp/PgDn / Home/End all work.
- In-source unit tests at `tabbed-picker.ts:1648` (`'Esc in filter mode clears query AND exits mode (D5-05)'`) and `:1661` (`'Enter in filter mode exits mode but preserves query (D5-05)'`) continue to pass because they drive the handler directly and bypass `onKeypress`.

**Suggested gap-closure approach (for a subsequent wave — NOT done in Plan 05-05 per Task 2 instruction):**
Override `TabbedGhostPicker.onKeypress` (or call `updateSettings({ aliases: {} })` from `@clack/core` at construction time) so that the escape → cancel and return → submit aliases are conditionally suppressed when `this.helpOpen` or `this.filterMode` is true. The cleanest fix is probably to wrap `onKeypress` on the subclass and skip the base call when those flags are set, then emit our own re-render.

**Test-coverage cost:**
- SC1 now asserts on `/` filter narrowing + Tab-clears-on-switch; D5-05/D5-06 Esc/Enter/Space sub-assertions are marked `it.todo` with precise blocker notes.
- SC3 closes the overlay via `?` toggle instead of Esc.
- SC5 exits filter mode via Enter (which silently submits the picker; the test asserts on exit code + no crash, so this incidental submit doesn't break the assertion).
- All other D5-* decisions have full pty coverage.

**Impact on Phase 5 acceptance:**
The `Esc` cancel-alias has always been the documented Ctrl+C-equivalent, so users losing their selection by pressing Esc is a regression against the ROADMAP SC1/SC3 acceptance criteria. Recommendation: **route to a small gap-closure wave BEFORE milestone v1.5 tag**, or accept the current behavior + update CHANGELOG/README to state Esc cancels the picker (alongside Ctrl+C and `q`). User decision at the human-verify checkpoint.

## Deviations from plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 3 — Blocking build] `no-useless-assignment` lint error in SC4 test**
- **Found during:** first `pnpm verify` run.
- **Issue:** Assigned `beforeLen` before the Home keystroke but then reassigned it in the next step without reading it.
- **Fix:** removed the unused early assignment.
- **Files modified:** `apps/ccaudit/src/__tests__/tabbed-picker-framework-group.test.ts`.
- **Commit:** `1e6ad09`.

**2. [Rule 3 — Blocking build] oxfmt whitespace drift in SC1 + SC2 tests**
- **Found during:** `pnpm format:check` step of `pnpm verify`.
- **Fix:** ran `pnpm format` to apply oxfmt output.
- **Files modified:** `tabbed-picker-filter.test.ts`, `tabbed-picker-sort-cycle.test.ts`.
- **Commit:** `1e6ad09`.

### Scope adjustments

**1. SC1 Esc / Enter / Space assertions routed to `it.todo`**
- **Reason:** pty probe revealed the @clack/core Esc→cancel / Enter→submit alias defect (see KNOWN-GAP above). Plan Task 2 explicitly says "DO NOT edit production code in this task. If a test reveals a Phase 5 bug, STOP and raise it — gap closure runs in a separate wave."
- **Impact:** the core D5-01/D5-02/D5-03 SC1 assertions still ship (filter narrows, Tab clears on switch); the D5-05/D5-06 Esc/Enter/Space sub-assertions are documented as `it.todo` with 20-line blocker notes pointing at `@clack/core/dist/index.mjs`.

**2. SC5 closes help via `?` toggle instead of Esc, exits filter via Enter**
- **Reason:** same defect class; `?` toggle is dispatch-safe because it is not aliased by @clack/core.
- **Impact:** the full-sequence smoke test still exercises all four new bindings — the only difference is the close gesture.

## Human-Verify Checkpoint

**Status: PENDING** — see the `<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">` instructions in `05-05-integration-tests-and-bundle-gate-PLAN.md`.

The plan's checkpoint asks the user to:

1. Run `node apps/ccaudit/dist/index.js ghost --interactive` on a real terminal (≥ 30r × 100c).
2. Verify live-counter footer (Phase 4), `/` filter (Phase 5-01), `s` sort (Phase 5-02), `?` help (Phase 5-03), framework-group Space (Phase 5-04), resize-during-filter stability, and Ctrl+C clean exit.
3. Confirm the bundle delta in this SUMMARY (< 10 KB).

**Recommended user-side action before approval:** decide whether the **KNOWN-GAP** (@clack/core Esc/Enter alias defect affecting D5-05/D5-06/D5-13) should be closed BEFORE the Phase 5 verify+milestone tag, or whether to ship v1.5 with the gap documented and address it in a v1.5.1 follow-up. This decision is upstream of the human-verify "approved / report issues" response.
